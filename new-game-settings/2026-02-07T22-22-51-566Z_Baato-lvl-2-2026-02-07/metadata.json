  "startingLocation": "Region name: Thornhaven Farmstead\n\nSummary: A dilapidated three-acre plot on Bramblewick's southeastern edge, featuring collapsed fencing, a partially ruined stone cottage, an overgrown garden patch with suspiciously mobile weeds, and a spring-fed pond that local monster girls find magnetically attractive. The previous owner's belongings remain scattered about, including cryptic journals and alchemical equipment of questionable legality. The surrounding woods teem with low-level threats and occasional wandering encounters. At night, strange lights sometimes emanate from beneath the cottage's floorboards.\n\nRooms/Locations: Overgrown Courtyard, Tool Shed (empty), Weed-Choked Garden, Spring Pond, Rickety Fence Perimeter, Hidden Grove (behind overgrowth), Collapsed Barn Foundation\n\nRegion exits: Baato's Farmhouse, Bramblewick Town, Deep Woods, Abandoned Mine Trail, Monster Girl Migration Path",
