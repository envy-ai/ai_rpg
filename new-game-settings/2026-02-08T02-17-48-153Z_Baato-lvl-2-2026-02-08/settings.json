The main house stands three stories tall in places, its stone foundation ancient and sturdy while wooden additions lean at optimistic angles. Overgrown fields stretch eastward toward Verdant Hollow's distant lights, while dense forest presses close from the west. A crumbling well in the yard conceals dungeon depths, and the barn's hayloft offers surprisingly comfortable sleeping quarters for unexpected guests. The land itself hums with dormant magic, responding strangely to attentive care.\n\nRooms/Locations: Overgrown Fields, Crumbling Well, Rickety Barn, Chicken Coop, Wildwood Edge, Garden Plot, Outdoor Bathhouse (under construction)\n\nRegion exits: Baato's Farmhouse, Verdant Hollow Town, The Deep Forest, Ancient Ruins, Slime Caverns",
