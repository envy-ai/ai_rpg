# Serialization & Shared Shapes (legacy index)

This file is kept for backward references. The authoritative, up-to-date shared shapes now live in:
- `docs/api/common.md`

If you are looking for:
- ChatEntry, NpcProfile, LocationResponse, NeedBar, etc. -> `docs/api/common.md`
- Map endpoint responses -> `docs/api/locations.md`

This file intentionally avoids duplicating the full schemas to prevent drift.
