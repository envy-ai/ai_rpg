Generate exactly one NPC entry for the character named "{{ npc.name }}". Use the XML structure below and keep the <name> element exactly "{{ npc.name }}". The NPC must feel grounded in the location and setting, with clear motivations or hooks for interaction.

If a field is already filled in, keep it as is and just fill in the remaining fields in a way that makes sense.

{% if oldItem %}Note that this NPC was created from the following item or scenery: "{{ oldItem.name }}", described as "{{ oldItem.description }}". The transformation is described as "{{ oldItem.transformationDescription }}". Use this as inspiration for the NPC's appearance, personality, and role.{% endif %}
