<task>You will be provided with an XML structure representing a an NPC, which may have some fields filled in and others left empty. Your task is to intelligently fill in the empty fields based on the context provided by the filled fields, ensuring that the completed XML is coherent and consistent.</task>

If the <name> field is already filled in, repeat it exactly and do not change it. Do not add titles, epithets, or descriptors to a prefilled name.

{% if hasImage %}A reference image is provided. Use it to guide the NPC's appearance, attire, vibe, standout details, and anything else not specified, keeping other fields consistent with what you see.{% endif %}

Note that an NPC is defined loosely here, and may be a creature, monster, or any other entity that functions as a non-player character in a text-based RPG setting.

Faction selection: use the full faction name from the <factions> list in the gameState. Use "None" if the NPC has no faction.

{% if oldItem %}Note that this NPC was created from the following item or scenery: "{{ oldItem.name }}", described as "{{ oldItem.description }}". The transformation is described as "{{ oldItem.transformationDescription }}". Use this as inspiration for the NPC's appearance, personality, and role.{% endif %}
