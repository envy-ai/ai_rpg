<task>
  Generate structured status effects for each provided seed.
  Each effect should have a concise description and any relevant attribute or skill modifiers that fit the current context.  Omit attributes or skills that are unaffected.
</task>

<statusEffectSeeds>
{% for seed in statusEffectSeeds %}
  <seed>
    <description>{{ seed.description }}</description>
    {% if seed.name %}<name>{{ seed.name }}</name>{% endif %}
    <level>{{ seed.level }}</level>
    <modifierRange>A positive or negative number with absolute value between {{ (seed.level / 2) | round }} and {{ (seed.level * 1.5) | round }}</modifierRange>
  </seed>
{% endfor %}
</statusEffectSeeds>

Guidelines:
- Skill and attribute modifiers should reflect the nature and level of the status effect. Treat the seed level as a reasomnable baseline for the magnitude of these modifiers.
- Multiple modifiers are fine. A single status effect may have multiple attribute and skill modifiers as appropriate (or one, or none at all if it makes sense).
- Use need bar changes to reflect ongoing effects of the status effect. For example, a "Poisoned" effect might decrease Health over time, while a "Blessed" effect might slowly restore Mana.
- Need bar deltas are *in addition to* any natural regeneration or depletion that occurs. For example, if Health normally regenerates at +1 per turn, and a status effect has a -2 delta to Health, the net effect is -1 Health per turn. Hence, negatives are *always* bad, and positives are *always* good.
- For instantaneous status effects (duration of 1), remember that they only happen once, so consider increasing the magnitude of any need bar changes significantly.

Respond in the following format:

<statusEffects>
  <effect>
    <sourceDescription><!-- seed description --></sourceDescription>
    <name><!-- Optional explicit name; use provided seed name when present --></name>
    <description><!-- Concise, 1-2 sentence description of the effect --></description>
    <duration><!-- Positive integer number of turns for the effect to last. Use 1 if instant and -1 if permanent. Use permanent durations VERY SPARINGLY. For instance, being full or well rested may last a long time, but should eventually expire on their own after a while. For longer duration effects, 30-60 turns is reasonable. For shorter, as low as 2 is fine, or anything in between. --></duration>
    <attributes>
      <attribute>
        <name><!-- Attribute name (use only attributes listed in the current setting) --></name>
        <modifier><!-- a positive or negative (non-zero) integer within the modifier range for this effect --></modifier>
      </attribute>
      <!-- Additional atttribute modifiers, or omit if no attribute modifiers -->
    </attributes>
    <skills>
      <skill>
        <name><!-- Skill name (use only skills listed in the current setting) --></name>
        <modifier><!-- a positive or negative (non-zero) integer within the modifier range for this effect --></modifier>

    </skills>
    <needBars>
      <needBar>
        <name><!-- Name of the need bar affected (the exact name of a need bar, or Health) --></name>
        <delta><!-- a positive or negative (non-zero) integer within the modifier range for this effect indicating how much the need bar changes per round. Positive is good, negative is bad. --></delta>
      </needBar>
      <!-- Additional need bar modifiers, or omit if no need bar modifiers -->
    </needBars>

  <!-- Additional status effects, one per seed -->
