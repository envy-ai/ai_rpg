<task>
{% if isStub %}
You are creating the region "{% if isStub %}{{ currentRegion.name }}{% else %}{{ regionName }}{% endif %}" described briefly below. Invent **new** locations that fit naturally within this region, without duplicating existing locations. Use judgments on how many new locations are appropriate (generally between {{ minLocations }} and {{ maxLocations }}, with larger places such as cities warranting more). Respect the established tone, geography, and level range. Describe how each new location connects to other locations in this region, explaining why those exits make sense. After defining the new locations, consider how this region links to other regions and propose any notable connected regions. If the region is not a building, ensure there are at least {{ minRegionExits }} non-'within' regionExit(s) among the locations.
{% elseif mode == 'exits' %}
You are analysing the current region and proposing meaningful connected regions that can be reached from it. Use the existing locations and themes to pick sensible exit points. Each connected region must include a description, a relative difficulty, the relationship (Within, Contains, Adjacent), and the location that serves as the exit.
{% else %}
Design a brand new region for the setting above. Propose between 1 and {{ maxLocations }} distinct locations that together form a coherent mini-map. Provide names, vivid three-sentence descriptions, relative levels, and explain the logic behind each intra-region exit. After the location list, suggest other regions that are reachable, contained, or containing this new region so navigation feels natural.

Guidelines: 
* Note that "region" is defined loosely as a set of related locations. Examples of regions can be a building, a city, a biome, a town, a dungeon, a cave system, a mountain range, etc. Regions can contain other regions or be adjacent to them. As a general rule, a building should have a location for the exterior and a regionExit for the interior. Regions can be as small as a single room building or vastly larger than that. Note that it is not necessary to generate a regionExit to the parent region, as it will already be connected; however, you may generate a regionExit to the parent region if it makes sense to have more than one.

* When proposing region exits, ensure the exit location you choose for each region makes sense given the current region's locations. For instance, if the current region is a starbase, any region that's not part of the starbase should have an exit location that is an airlock or docking bay.

* If you generate a location that would hint at a new region, generate a regionExit for that new region. For example, if you create a location called "Ancient Temple Exterior", it would make sense to have a regionExit to a new region called "Ancient Temple Interior". A cave would suggest a cave system region, building would suggest an interior, etc. If a location is a building/cave/dungeon/etc exterior, always include a regionExit for the building interior and make sure to include the word "Exterior" in the location name.

* When creating locations, make sure that the location makes sense inside the region. For instance, a "blacksmith's workshop" would not make sense as a location inside a forest region, but it would make sense inside a village region. It's good to generate locations mentioned in dialogue and quests, but only if they make sense for the region.

* Always avoid contradictions with the setting, and use consistent terminology (e.g., Within, Contains, Adjacent) when describing regional relationships.

* Furniture and workstations are not locations. These should be mentioned in the description, but will be generated as scenery later. For example, a "blacksmith's forge" is not a location, but a "blacksmith's workshop" is.

{% if currentRegion.name %}Output XML in the following format for the region named "{{ currentRegion.name }}".{% elseif regionName %}Output XML in the following format for a new region named "{{ regionName }}".{% else %}Create a region using the following XML format.{% endif %}

{% if minRegionExits %}If this region isn't a building, provide at least 3 non-'within' regionExit(s) among the locations, with at least 3 of them being exits to entirely new regions.{% endif %}

If this region is a city, town, village, or other settlement, create at least three building exteriors as locations, each with a regionExit for the interior.

{% if regionNotes %}Generate a region based on this description: "{{ regionNotes }}".{% endif %} Use the following XML structure exactly:

  <regionName>{% if isStub %}{{ currentRegion.name }}{% else %}{{ regionName }}{% endif %}</regionName>
  <regionDescription><!-- Three sentences that describe this region. --></regionDescription>
  <relativeLevel>1</relativeLevel>{# Set to 1 to keep the AI from going nuts with high relative levels for locations. This value doesn't affect actual generation. #}
