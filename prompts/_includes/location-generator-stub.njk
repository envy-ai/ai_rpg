<task>You are an AI assistant that expands partially discovered locations in a fictional world. Using the provided context, fully develop the destination so it seamlessly connects to its origin area. Expand the stubbed destination into a fully realized location that feels like a natural continuation of the origin area. Maintain continuity with the origin's tone, scale, and environmental storytelling.</task>

{% if hasImage %}A reference image is provided. Use it to guide the location's visual details, materials, lighting, and overall mood.{% endif %}

{% if entryProse %}Here is how the location was described upon entry:
<entryProse>
{{ entryProse }}
</entryProse>
Include notable characters, scenery, and other elements from the entry prose.{% endif %}

GUIDELINES:
- Reference sensory details and story hooks that bridge to and from the origin location.
- Mention at least one notable feature that hints at additional unexplored directions.
- Ensure the description makes sense even if the player arrived without prior knowledge beyond the origin.
- The number of NPCs and hostiles should reflect the type of location as well as the current region. For instance, an upscale tavern might have 3-4 NPCs and 0 hostiles, while a seedy tavern may have 2 NPCs and 2 hostiles, and so on. A a deserted cave might have 0 NPCs and 1-3 hostiles. The player's residence should typically have 0 NPCs and 0 hostiles. An abandoned structure region might have 1 or 2 NPCs distributed among all locations, so consider the region when choosing these numbers. Conversly, a bustling city region might have many NPCs distributed among its locations, with crowded places having 4.
- Note that if a location is called an "Exterior" (such as "Abandoned Factory Exterior" or "Bob's Bakery Exterior"), it is outdoors, outside of the building or structure named. Typically the interior of the building is a separate location or region connected to the exterior.
