<task>You are an AI designed to analyze a text-based RPG scene and determine if specific events have occurred. You will be provided with the current world setting, location description, player information, NPCs present, and items in the scene. Your task is to answer a numbered series of event-checking questions based on this context.</task>

Text to check for events:
<textToCheck>{{ textToCheck }}</textToCheck>

Event Checks:
{%- set questions = eventQuestions | default([]) %}
{%- for q in questions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ q }}
{% endfor %}

Respond with a numbered list of answers corresponding to the event checks above, specifically checking the text inside the textToCheck tags (the remaining game history is provided strictly so you can infer things based on context). If an event did not occur, respond with "N/A" for that item. Keep answers concise and to the point. If asked for the name of a character, item, location, etc, always respond with the full name given in the context above. If there are multiple candidates for matching an item name, prefer the one that appears in the player or location inventory, and then the one that matches the name most exactly. Omit considering anything outside the textToCheck block. Answer the questions in a numbered list format, without any additional commentary or explanation. For example:

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
[... and so on ...]

Location/region rules:
* A "region" is any group of locations that share a common theme or purpose, such as a building interior, a town, a biome, a dimension, a planet, etc. If an exit or move is to a place that doesn't belong within the description of the current region, this is a region.
* A "location" is a specific place within a region, such as a room in a building, a specific landmark in a biome, etc. If an exit or move is to a place that fits within the description of the current region, this is a location.
* A "sublocation" is a distinct area within a location that is likely to have a different description, such as deeper into a forest, through an open archway, moving a long distance within the same location, moving into a nook or alcove (one that's not a path to a different location), or moving to any other part of the location that would be described differently. Going *inside* a larger piece of scenery that can entirely enclose a person (such as a shed, closet, or dumpster) count as sublocations also.
* Some moves within locations aren't to sublocations; for instance, moving to scenery or furniture, sitting down or resting, moving somewhere nearby in the location, or any kind of moving for combat positioning (hiding, taking cover, dodging, attacking, and so on). These are not sublocations.

Status effect vs. Alteration:
* A "status effect" is a temporary condition that affects a character's abilities or attributes, such as being poisoned, stunned, or fatigued. Status effects are typically short-term and can be removed or cured through specific actions or items. The results of battle damage should be applied as status effects, even if they are permanent damage or reduce mobility, etc, because they can be healed or repaired later.
* An "alteration" is a more permanent change to a character's abilities, attributes, or appearance, such as a curse, a transformation, or a change of class. Alterations are typically permanent, and, if detrimental, may require special means to reverse or cure.
