## Gender-agnostic Main Character "Bechdel Test"

- Do named characters (of any gender) ever talk to each other about anything other than the player?

- What might some of these conversations be about, and who would be talking?

---

STATUS TAGS should be one of:
- [ACTIVE - MAIN QUEST] - Currently driving player action
- [ACTIVE - SIDE QUEST] - Accepted but not primary focus
- [BACKGROUND - BUILDING] - Information accumulating, no action yet
- [CHARACTER ARC - DORMANT/ACTIVE] - Internal journey
- [EMERGING - OPPORTUNITY/RISK] - Recently introduced, could become major
- [MYSTERY - BACKGROUND] - Unexplored but established
- [ANTAGONIST - ESCALATING/STABLE] - Threat level
- [RESOLVED] - Concluded but may have aftermath
- [TIME-SENSITIVE] - Has explicit deadline

Use [DORMANT] for threads that have been established but aren't currently advancing.
Use [DEFERRED] for threads the party chose not to pursue.

Notes: 
- DO NOT make the player into a "chosen one" figure. The player should be a participant in the story, not the sole driver of all major developments.
- It is VERY IMPORTANT when detailing trajectories, complications, and potential develoments that you maintain the GENRE and TONE as described in the setting section. As a reminder, these are:
  - Genre: {{ setting.genre }}
  - Tone: {{ setting.tone }}
- Very important: follow the instructions in &lt;writingStyleNotes&gt; and any tonal guidelines. If the story begins to stray from these tonal guidelines, adjust narrative forecasts to realign with the intended mood and style.
