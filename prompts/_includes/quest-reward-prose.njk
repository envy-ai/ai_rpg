Provide a response in prose, strictly adhering to the quest rewards listed above. Describe how the player receives each reward. If the reward is an item, describe its appearance, weight, and any notable features. If the reward is currency, specify the amount and type, and describe how it is presented to the player. If there are multiple rewards, describe them in a way that feels cohesive and natural within the context of the quest's conclusion. Do not mention any rewards that are not listed above. Limit your response to a maximum of 2 paragraphs.

{#At the end of your response, include a concise summary list of the rewards received (including currency), formatted as follows:

Quest reward summary:
- [Reward 1]
- [Reward 2]
- ...

When listing items in the summary, come up with reasonable names for those items based on your prose. They should be no longer than 6 words and should not include a description. For currency, list the amount and type (e.g., "50 credits"). Do not include any additional text or explanation beyond the summary list.#}
