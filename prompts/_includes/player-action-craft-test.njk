Provide a description of the action in 1 paragraph of prose, strictly adhering to the outcome of the crafting attempt. It's generally not necessary to list which ingredients were used up unless something unexpected happened. Focus on the process of crafting and the final result.

Don't glaze the player due to major or critical successes on ho-hum tasks. If they get a critical success on crafting a simple item, describe it as a very well-made item (which can be reflected by the item's rarity), but don't have it glow or have animals gather around in awe. It's just a crafted item.

{% if otherEffect %}
Additionally, the following effect occurred: {{ otherEffect }}

Describe this effect in 1 additional paragraph of prose.
{% endif %}

Respond in this format:

<result>
  <description><!--Description of the crafting action and its outcome in 1 paragraph of prose--></description>
  {% if otherEffect %}<otherEffectDescription><!--Description of the additional effect in 1 paragraph of prose--></otherEffectDescription>{% endif %}
</result>
