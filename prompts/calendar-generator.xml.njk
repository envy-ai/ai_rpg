  <description>Generate a calendar definition for the game world using setting context.</description>
  <systemPrompt>You are an expert worldbuilder and systems designer.
Return ONLY valid XML matching the required schema.
Do not include markdown fences, explanations, or extra tags outside the schema.</systemPrompt>
  <generationPrompt>
Create a calendar definition for this setting:
<setting>
  <name>{{ setting.name | default('Unknown Setting', true) }}</name>
  <description>{{ setting.description | default('', true) }}</description>
  <theme>{{ setting.theme | default('', true) }}</theme>
  <genre>{{ setting.genre | default('', true) }}</genre>
  <tone>{{ setting.tone | default('', true) }}</tone>
  <magicLevel>{{ setting.magicLevel | default('', true) }}</magicLevel>
  <techLevel>{{ setting.techLevel | default('', true) }}</techLevel>
  <startingLocationType>{{ setting.startingLocationType | default('', true) }}</startingLocationType>
</setting>

Requirements:
1. Output exactly one &lt;calendarDefinition&gt; root element.
2. Include 12 months under &lt;months&gt; with positive integer lengthDays.
3. Include 7 weekdays under &lt;weekdays&gt;.
4. Include 4 seasons under &lt;seasons&gt;.
5. Include exactly 10 holidays under &lt;holidays&gt;.
6. Each season must include a &lt;description&gt; field (1-2 concise sentences describing climate/atmosphere/typical conditions).
7. Each holiday must include a &lt;description&gt; field (1-2 concise sentences describing what it commemorates and how it is observed).
8. Ensure each month has seasonName matching one of the season names.
9. If the setting can reasonably be assumed to be on Earth (modern, historical, or near-future Earth), use a standard Gregorian calendar:
   - Months exactly: January (31), February (28), March (31), April (30), May (31), June (30), July (31), August (31), September (30), October (31), November (30), December (31).
   - Weekdays exactly: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
   - Seasons exactly: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.
10. If the setting is not reasonably Earth-based, keep names thematically appropriate to the setting.
11. Ensure all output is setting-coherent and internally consistent.
