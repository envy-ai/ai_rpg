Here is a list of all character attributes:
{% for attrName, attrDef in attributeDefinitions %}- {{ attrName }}: {{ attrDef.description }} 
{% endfor %}

Attributes for an NPC should be rated as one of: poor, below average, average, above average, excellent, legendary.

These NPC names are banned (names should not contain any of these):
{% for word in bannedWords %}- {{ word }}
{% endfor %}

{#
Here's a list of existing NPCs (don't generate these again):
{% for npc in existingNpcsInOtherRegions %}- {{ npc.name }}: {{ npc.shortDescription }} 
{% endfor %}
#}
Here is a list of banned NPC concepts
- Self-appointed guardian
- Person who gives cryptic advice

Faction selection: use the full faction name from the <factions> list in the gameState. Use "None" if the NPC has no faction.

{#
Here's a list of existing NPCs in other locations in this region:
{% for npc in existingNpcsInOtherLocations %}- {{ npc.name }}: {{ npc.shortDescription }}

<task>
{# First, make a list of names of existing NPCs from the gameState tag. #}

First, generate {{ numNpcs }} additional NPC(s) {% if numHostiles > 0 %}and {{ numHostiles }} new hostile entities (can be NPCs, monsters, or other entities of any type that makes sense) {% endif %}for the location above, chosen from the characterConcepts{% if numHostiles > 0 %} and enemyConcepts lists, respectively{% endif %}. **IMPORTANT: The generated NPC must be entirely new and not match any existing NPC from the gameState, not just those in the current location. Check thoroughly against the entire list of existing NPCs.**

Then, generate 3 short memories for each newly generated NPC, from their perspective, about recent significant events they have experienced. These should be no more than 2 sentences long each, and should include interactions with other NPCs, places, things, etc.

Finally, check each newly generated NPC against the banned names, banned concepts, and ALL existing NPCs in the gameState. If any newly generated NPC matches one of these, generate a new NPC to replace it.
