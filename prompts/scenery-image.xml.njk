Scenery Description:
    {{ thingDescription | replace('\n', '\n    ') }}

Be sure to describe both the thing and the surrounding location, keeping the setting aesthetics in mind. The thing should be shown on a simple grey background. Only describe what the thing presently looks like. For instance, if the item has been rebuilt recently, do not mention what it looked like before it was rebuilt, or that it has been transformed in any way. Strictly describe the current appearance of the thing.
